|      9996 | cDNA sequence BC011390                              | On February 19, 2002, this locus was switched from human to mouse. The source accession, Z70200.1, is almost identical to the mouse BAC clone AC074224, and it matches the mouse cDNA accession BC011390 as well. The human gene is LocusID 23020.

|     11298 | arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase                  | The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the acetyltransferase superfamily. It is the penultimate enzyme in melatonin synthesis and controls the night/day rhythm in melatonin production in the vertebrate pineal gland. Melatonin is essential for the function of the circadian clock that influences activity and sleep. This enzyme is regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation that promotes its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and thus protects the enzyme against proteasomal degradation. This gene may contribute to numerous genetic diseases such as delayed sleep phase syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

|     11303 | ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 1 | The membrane-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the ABC1 subfamily. Members of the ABC1 subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes. In humans, this protein functions as a cholesterol efflux pump in the cellular lipid removal pathway. Mutations in the human gene have been associated with Tangier's disease and familial high-density lipoprotein deficiency.

|     11304 | ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 4 | The membrane-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the ABC1 subfamily. Members of the ABC1 subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes. This protein was the first of the ABC transporters to be observed in photoreceptors and may play a role in the photoresponse. Mutations in the human gene are found in patients diagnosed with Stargardt disease and are associated with retinitis pigmentosa-19 and macular degeneration age-related 2.

|     11307 | ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1           | The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the White subfamily. The human protein is involved in macrophage cholesterol efflux and may regulate cellular lipid homeostasis in other cell types.

|     11363 | acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long-chain           | This gene encodes a homotetrameric mitochondrial flavoprotein and is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family. Members of this family catalyze the first step of fatty acid beta-oxidation, forming a C2-C3 trans-double bond in a FAD-dependent reaction. As beta-oxidation cycles through its four steps, each member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family works at an optimum fatty acid chain-length. This enzyme has its optimum length between C12- and C16-acylCoA. In mice, deficiency of this gene can cause sudden death, cardiomyopathy as well as fasting and cold intolerance.

|     11364 | acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, medium chain         | This gene encodes a homotetrameric mitochondrial flavoprotein and is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family. Members of this family catalyze the first step of fatty acid beta-oxidation, forming a C2-C3 trans-double bond in a FAD-dependent reaction. As beta-oxidation cycles through its four steps, each member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family works at an optimum fatty acid chain-length. This enzyme has its optimum length between C6- and C12-acylCoA. In mice, deficiency of this gene can cause neonatal mortality as well as fasting and cold intolerance. This gene has multiple, intronless pseudogenes.

|     11370 | acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, very long chain      | This gene encodes a homodimeric mitochondrial flavoprotein and is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family. Members of this family catalyze the first step of fatty acid beta-oxidation, forming a C2-C3 trans-double bond in a FAD-dependent reaction. As beta-oxidation cycles through its four steps, each member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family works at an optimum fatty acid chain-length. This enzyme has its optimum length between C16- and C20-acylCoA and localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (unlike related acyl-CoA dehydrogenases). In mice, deficiency of this gene can cause ventricular arrhythmias as well as fasting and cold intolerance.

|     11409 | acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, short chain          | This gene encodes a homotetrameric mitochondrial flavoprotein and is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family. Members of this family catalyze the first step of fatty acid beta-oxidation, forming a C2-C3 trans-double bond in a FAD-dependent reaction. As beta-oxidation cycles through its four steps, each member of the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family works at an optimum fatty acid chain-length. This enzyme has its optimum at C(four)-CoA. In mice, deficiency of this gene has been linked to cold sensitivity and increased high-density lipoprotein levels.
